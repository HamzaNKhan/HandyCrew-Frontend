# HandyCrew-Backend

Handy Crew is a worker welfare system designed to transform how a person finds works. We bridge the gap between an employer and a worker by providing 
an easy to use online system for searching and hiring everyday workers such as drivers, maids, electricians and plumbers, among a host of similar 
blue-collar/ non-formal professions.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The inspiration behind The Handy Crew was the difficulties one would face of finding a professional technician Furthermore, they were often just not available or reliable, 
or simply charged way over what is considered reasonable. It was clear that there was a need for a professional handyman service, and we jumped at the idea!
